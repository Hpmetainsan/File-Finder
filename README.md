# FILE FINDER TOOL

File Finder is an interesting web tool, using LeakIX API resources to search for exposed internet files. This tool often helped me when I was searching for certain files on the internet and checking if this site which contains this file was registered with a bug bunty program, it is really the perfect and interesting tool. 

the current version is a version is a graphical version so if you run it on terminal you will not have a good rendering, and it requires an internet connection to better connect to the internet and search files, so if you want it use you can opt for `REPLI` or your own web server which runs `PHP`.
